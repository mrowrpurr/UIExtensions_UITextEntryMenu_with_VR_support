# UIExtensions `UITextEntryMenu` with VR support

Patch to `UITextEntryMenu` from UIExtensions with support for Skyrim VR (via VR Keyboard)

The original `UITextEntryMenu` is not my code, the original mod can be found here:

This "just works" with all versions of Skyrim.

For VR it works when VR Keyboard is installed:
